    """**DC Restoration**

    One interesting clamp application is “dc restoration” of a signal that has been ac coupled (capacitively coupled). Diagram shows the idea. This is particularly important for circuits whose inputs look like diodes (e.g., a transistor with grounded emitter); otherwise an ac-coupled signal will just fade away, as the coupling capacitor charges up to the signal’s peak voltage.
