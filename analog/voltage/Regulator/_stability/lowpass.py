    """**Eliminate the effect of ripple current**

    A nice variation of this circuit aims to eliminate the effect of ripple current (through `R`) on the zener voltage by supplying the zener current from a current source, which is the subject of §2.2.6. An alternative method uses a lowpass filter in the zener bias circuit. `R` is chosen such that the series pair provides sufficient zener current. Then `C` is chosen large enough so that `RC ≫ 1/ f_(rippl\e)`.
