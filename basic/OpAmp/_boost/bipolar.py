        ## Bipolar emitter follower power booster
        For high output current, a power transistor follower can be hung on an op-amp output.

        In this case a non-inverting amplifier has been drawn, though a follower can be added
        to any op-amp configuration.

        Notice that feedback is taken from the emitter; thus feedback enforces the desired output voltage
        in spite of the `V_(BE)` drop. This circuit has the usual problem that the follower output can only source current.
