        A capacitor (the old-fashioned name was condenser) is a device that has two wires sticking out of it and has the property
       `Q = CV` (1)

        A capacitor of `C` farads with `V` volts across its terminals has `Q` coulombs of stored charge on one plate and `−Q` on the other. 
        
        Taking the derivative of the defining equation 1, you get
        `I = C (dV)/(dt)`

        So a capacitor is more complicated than a resistor: the current is not simply proportional to the voltage, but rather to the rate of change of voltage. If you change the voltage across a farad by 1 volt per second, you are supplying an amp. Conversely, if you supply an amp, its voltage changes by 1 volt per second. A farad is an enormous capacitance, and you usually deal in microfarads (μF), nanofarads (nF), or picofarads (pF).

        When you charge up a capacitor, you’re supplying energy. The capacitor doesn’t get hot; instead, it stores the energy in its internal electric fields.
