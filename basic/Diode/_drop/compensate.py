    """**Compensating Diode Forward Voltage Drop**

    A possible circuit solution to this problem of finite diode drop. Here D1 compensates D2‚Äôs forward drop by providing 0.6 V of bias
    to hold D2 at the threshold of conduction. Using a diode (D1) to provide the bias (rather than, say, a voltage divider) has severalo
    advantages: (a) there is nothing to adjust, (b) the compensation will be nearly perfect, and (c) changes of the forward drop (e.g., with changing temperature) will be compensated properly.

        The purpose of R1 is to act as a flexible linkage to separate the reference 0.6 voltage, which is quite stiff,
        from the point where the signal is injected, which must on the contrary be free to swing about 0.6V.

        R1 also protects the diode from the input current swings. If we replace R1 by a wire, it won't work because
        the signal will try to move the voltage at the top of D1, whose cathode is pinned to ground.
        The input's positive swings will dump current through D1, abusing it. That creates a poor input impedance,
        resulting in an inability to generate the right voltage on or under D2.

        On the other hand, if R1 is made large, the compensation diminishes, because the reference
        voltage is able to exert less control over the bias.
